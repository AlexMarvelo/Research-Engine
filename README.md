## Installation

### AS A USER
[Install from the Chrome store here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/worldbrain-the-research-e/abkfbakhjpmblaafnpgjppbmioombali/related). (If you don't feel comfortable with that, look at [Transparent Installation](#transparent-installation)).
#### Transparent Installation
If you don't feel comfortable installing a Chrome extension that can read and modify all data on the websites you visit from the webstore (we wouldn't either!), you can clone this repository on your local machine, read through our code to verify that it is not malicious, and then install it as an unpacked local extension through the menu in `chrome://extensions/`. **But this way you also won't receive any updates**.
